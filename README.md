## Introduction

For this project, I wanted to predict baseball salaries using player position and team. I scraped the data from USA for the 2019 season.

In the project, I used the following libraries:

    - BeautifulSoup
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - Sklearn
    - Matplotlib
    - Seaborn

In this repo you will find the jupyter notebook with the code to scrape the website as well as clean the data, perform EDA and model.
